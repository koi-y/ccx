# Detect code clones #
## Importing a repository ##
CCX can detect code clones from public Git repositories.

To register your repository with CCX, enter the URL of your repository in the [https://sel.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/webapps/ccx/new] form and import it. Depending on the repository, the import may take several minutes.

Private Git repositories are not supported.

After the import is complete, you will be redirected to the project top page.

## Setting the detection tools and parameters ##
Go to the top page of the project and click the button at the top left of the screen to display the menu. Select "Clone Detection" from the menu to set the detection tools and parameters to be used.
After completing the settings, press the RUN DETECTOR button to start the code clone detection.

Press the ADD DETECTOR button to save the settings and open the next setting window. Pressing the RUN DETECTOR button at the end repeats the above procedure to execute the saved settings sequentially.

The upper left corner of the screen shows the current execution status (Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed), but since it is not automatically updated, please reload the screen to check the current status.
